/* Hi intruder,
I hope this message finds you well. I noticed some unusual activity regarding the inspection of our code through the browser's developer tools. While I understand that code reviews are a crucial part of our collaborative process, I want to ensure that we are all on the same page regarding access and permissions.

If there's a specific reason you need to inspect the code, please let me know, and we can discuss how to facilitate that process more effectively. Open communication is key to maintaining a smooth workflow, and I want to make sure everyone is comfortable with the procedures in place.

If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to reach out. Let's work together to ensure my coding environment remains secure and transparent.

Best regards,
keshav chaudhary */
